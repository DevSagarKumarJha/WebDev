## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.

For example, consider the following line of text:
``` text
My cat is very grumpy
```

If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (`<p>`) element:

```HTML
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

```Note:
 Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <title> tag could be written as <title>, <TITLE>, <Title>, <TiTlE>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.
```
## Anatomy of an HTML element
Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:
<img src="../Images/grumpy-cat-small.png">

The anatomy of our element is:

- The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
- The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

### Nesting Elements
Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <`strong`> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```
<div style="background: white; color:black; border: 2px">
<h2 style="color:black">
Output:
</h2>
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
</div>

There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p.

The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:

```html 
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>
```

The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.

### Void Elements
Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements. For example, the <`img`> element embeds an image file onto a page:

```html
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
  alt="Firefox icon" />

```
<div style="background: white; color:black; height: 45vh">
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
  alt="Firefox icon" />
</div>
<br/>

```note
Note: In HTML, there is no requirement to add a / at the end of a void element's tag, for example: <img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="cat"/>. However, it is also a valid syntax, and you may do this when you want your HTML to be valid XML.
